## Webpage Details
This is a simple application of an employee directory. It populates the entire database of employees, allows the user to search by last name and sort the age from least to greatest and vice versa. Plenty of opportunity for development, along with additional sort/filter options.

## Demo Video

## Requirements
Given a table of random users generated from the [Random User API](https://randomuser.me/), when the user loads the page, a table of employees should render. 

The user should be able to:

  * Sort the table by at least one category

  * Filter the users by at least one property.
